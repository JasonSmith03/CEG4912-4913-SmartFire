Close or Restart the terminal.
In the command line, navigate to the project directory and run "yarn b" to start the application.

*If the terminal says error: Unrecognized command "run-android", then please run "yarn" in the terminal, followed by "yarn b" again. This should fix any errors and run the android app. Please be patient as it takes a few minutes to load.
